## Repository description

Two main folders are made to handle the data; in a true 
production environment each one should be a repository by its own. 

## Metadata

Stores the schema of each input source and its output table as well as requirements.

## Ingestion engine

Make ingestion of different data sources to Delta Tables. In the future, tests and 
data cleaning can be added as well as feature engineering.


## Clarifications

Passwords are stored at compute level or in Databricks/Azure vaults.
